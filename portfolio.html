                                I trained a model using <a href = "https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/" target = "_blank">Teachable Machine</a> to recognize rock, paper, and scissors! Then, I used this model and added in some
                                Python to recognize an image as rock, paper, or scissors.

                                I replicated Wordle in Java using JavaFX! It has all of the ordinary features Wordle on hard mode has
                                with a few more additions such as a save/load feature!

                                ongoing project experimenting with CSS styles and will soon have the addition of a dark mode!

                                I have my own online shops through Bigcartel and Etsy, but I would like to have my own domain.
                                Bigcartel charges money for more listings and Etsy takes a cut out of my sales. I'd like to be able to
                                host my own online shop to avoid these issues!
