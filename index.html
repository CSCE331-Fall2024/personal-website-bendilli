                <h3>The face behind the website:</h3>
                <p>
                    Howdy! My name is Judy Liu, and I am a junior at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science based in Pearland, Texas.
                     I am currently minoring in Cybersecurity and Game Development, and it is an honor to meet your acquaintance!
                
                <h3>About Computer Science:</h3>

                <p>
                    I have always been fascinated by computers, especially since my dad is a software developer. I decided to follow in his footsteps, 
                    and now I specialize in software development, app development, and cybersecurity fields. However, I also have a graphic design and 
                    art background, giving me the flexibility to work on front-end projects too! I exercise a level of creativity that is difficult to 
                    come by in a STEM field and can make a great addition to any team due to my flexibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the moment, I am currently looking for software/app development internships to broaden my project experience. Additionally, I want to 
                    explore more opportunities related to cybersecurity and risk.
                </p>

                <h2>My Previous Experience:</h2>

                <p>
                    I have previously worked as a camp instructor at iD Tech, where I worked with over 50 kids and taught them foundational 
                    programming skills in Python and Java. I also introduced machine learning concepts to the older kids by utilizing OpenAI API 
                    keys to make wrapper classes for chatbots.
                </p>

                <h2>Outside of Computer Science:</h2>

                <p>
                    Outside of computer science and school, I have a passion for video games and art! I have my own art business where I do custom artwork for clients and 
                    create video game and cartoon-inspired merchandise. This includes vinyl stickers, acrylic keychains, acrylic standees, tote bags, 
                    and prints of my artwork! Iâ€™m very passionate about product design and graphic design, as you can see on this website!
                </p>

                <h2>Thank you!</h2>

                <p>
                    On this website, you can take a look at the various projects that I have done, my qualifications, the services I have done, 
                    and an AI-generated page where you can reach out to me should you have any questions, comments, or concerns! 
                    Additionally, you can take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/judy-liu-03945a219/">LinkedIn</a>! Thank you for taking a look at my website and I hope to hear more from you soon!
