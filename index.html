                <p>
                    Howdy! My name is Judy Liu, and I am a junior at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science. I am currently
                    minoring in Cybersecurity and Game Development, and it is an honor to meet your acquaintance!
                <p>
                    I’m a twenty-year-old American-born Chinese girl living in Houston with my parents, older sister, and younger
                    brother! All of us except my mom, a real estate agent, study computer science and software development! I grew up
                    in Baton Rouge, Louisiana until I moved to Houston in 2012, and I have been here ever since.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Growing up, I had a fascination for everything computer-related. This includes graphics, software, and hardware!
                    At the moment, however, I have not decided which field I would like to specialize in. I love doing front-end and
                    back-end development equally and I am considered a beginner in both fields, so I am taking the time to experiment
                    and explore my options.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of computer science and school, I am a gamer and artist! I have my own art business where I do custom
                    artwork for clients and create video game and cartoon-inspired merchandise. This includes vinyl stickers, acrylic
                    keychains, acrylic standees, tote bags, and prints of my artwork! I’m very passionate about product design and
                    graphic design, as you can see on this website!
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a team, I exercise a level of creativity that is difficult to come by in a STEM field and can make a great
                    addition to any group due to my flexibility. I'm a strong communicator, fast learner, and I am easily adaptable to
                    any scenario. I have a strong background in programming and engineering, and most of all, I am eager to learn and improve!
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this website, you can take a look at the various projects that I have done, my qualifications, the services
                    I have done, and a page where you can reach out to me should you have any questions, comments, or concerns! Thank
                    you for taking a look at my website and I hope to hear more from you soon!
                </p>
