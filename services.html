                                In Century Scholars, I volunteer at least 5 hours every semester in the Bryan/College Station areas! My services range from
                                packing Christmas gifts at Salvation Army, volunteering at animal shelters and food banks, and doing yard and housework for elderly people.

                                At Aggie Women in Computer Science, I signed up to be a mentor through the Rubies program!
                                Here, I was paired with an underclassman student either looking to enter or new to the 
                                TAMU Computer Science Program. I would spend time with my mentees and guide them through registration
                                processes, what classes and programs I recommended, and just be a friend!

                                From 2020 until 2022, I was a volunteer math tutor for Learn in Shelter! Here, I was paired
                                with a third-grade student with learning disabilities who was struggling with math. I would develop
                                weekly lesson plans, communicate with his parent, and hold weekly math lessons. I accumulated over 80
                                volunteer hours through this program, including the time taken to develop lesson plans.
